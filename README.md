# InVessel

## Introduction

InVessel is a simple dependency injection/inversion of control container, based on [zend-servicemanager](https://docs.zendframework.com/zend-servicemanager/). It promotes decoupling and reusability while aiming at preservation of flexibility. Some of its features are:

* lazy loading of entries
* user-defined entry caching/sharing
* entry aliasing
